				<h1> Short Story:</h1>
				<div class = "storytext">
				<p>Scores of barren lands could be seen as far as the eye could be seen. Glittered with discarded weapons of wars now long past as they shone with the blinding light of the bright noon sky. Skeletons decorated in armors from throughout the ages littered the ground as Mulligan trekked the valley of death. Mulligan had been scavenging from these lands for years ever since he had settled on a river nearby.</p>
<br>
<p>There used to be many other people who would go with Mulligan on these treks before. A long time ago, Mulligan and many other people had settled on the river nearby creating homes for their families and themselves. But they were long gone now leaving only Mulligan behind in his lonely river home of his. Now those days filled with company were now gone due to The War.</p>
<br>
<p>The starting days of The War had been chaotic for Mulligan. His children had been drafted into the war effort almost immediately when The War had begun. Some freak accident with some quantum technology was what had been the cause for The War but he could not care less. His family was now gone and that was all he cared for but even that was taken for the war effort. Now he stands alone in his humble abode reminiscing of times long past reminded by the memories of better days with each glance. Loneliness was a challenging thing, Mulligan deals with on most peaceful afternoons like these but he had learnt to be okay with it after a few years. He busied himself with his own hobbies after everyone left for The War but he still felt pangs of sorrow.</p>
<br>
<p>The ground crunched beneath his foot as he made his way through the valley of death. Mulligan heaved his backpack and salvage through the long dead corpses and weapons. The sight of a long-ago crashed warship beckoned his call as he met the poor ship's sight, decrypt and rusted. He made his way through the field of the dead with the sight of the warship ever increasing with each step. Good salvage made their homes in warships and Mulligan needed some new salvage for his new project.</p>
<br>
<p>Mulligan used to want to be soldier when he grew up, stories of his mum and dad saving towns and cities from their doom enthralled his young mind but those stories would never prepare him for war. He remembers the dead and wounded dying, the friends he lost, and the wife he had. He loved fighting for his species, contributing to a bigger cause but after years of war he retired to raise his children by himself.</p>
<br>
<p>When Elisa died, the event broke young Mulligan as he fell into grief over it. Left to raise his own children alone, he hardened his heart for the arduous task ahead of him, with the prospect of raising teenagers by himself ever hardening his heart a bit more. The day when he saw his own children go to war, broke his heart to see his own children to be sent into the business he had retired from.</p>
<br>
<p><Metal groaned as he pried open the sealed airlock with his trusty crowbar. Grinding and moans of the metal finally gave way after minutes of prying and effort from Mulligan. The rush of stale air blew through his face giving way to a view of dark rusted decrypt hallway. Light from the outside billowed into the hallway from the airlock lighting up scars of battle and struggle across the hallway. He grabbed his backpack and took out his flashlight, turning it on and taking his first steps into the long dead warship.</p>
<br>
<p>Soldiers of the HTG all required mandatory service in one of the many ships of the HTG, Mulligan reminisced as he looked upon the familiar architecture. His service upon of the ships of the HTG was served upon the Excalibur warship with his friends and squad. Days of his old past were relit as he remembered the slow hours of the day when he and his squad would round up and play a game of cards, days of "accidentally" launching a missile into the depths of space, and the relaxing times when he just rested.</p>
<br>
<p>The Excalibur was his second home in the military but when it fell, it only showed him the true horrors of war. Memories of the attack and fleet falling as he was deployed onto the planet's surface bubbled to the surface. Raining hellfire of molten metal and barrages filled the sky and encompassed his view as he fought. Death and destruction prevailed where hope and peace failed, weapons of man used on their fellow man melting flesh and bones.</p>
<br>
<p>After hours of searching through the deserted warship stumbling upon skeletons and scars of battles long past, he had reached the engine room. Mulligan's light from his flashlight illuminated the dreary reactor core warped by damage from a battle years ago. The wires dangled from the ceiling with exposed paneling revealing circuitry on the walls and floors. He stood dead center of the room, the stale air giving an atmosphere of awe with the sight of the reactor core in front of him. The sound of decaying radioactive material ticking the faint Giger counter left behind by some poor soul.</p>
<br>
<p>He stood dauntlessly staring into the reactor core and with invigorated passion, a new idea was born. His idea was stupid almost reckless to the point of death but his family was long gone and nowhere left to go. Repairing such a warship would take time and resources and it was quite luckily that Mulligan had both in plethora. The planning of such an idea was nigh horrendous to think about but he remembered one thing said by his Elisa before she died.</p>
<br>
<p>"Live, live like you dare to. Do not let me or anyone else keep you down by our own memory, live for me"</p>
<br>
<p>And he would live like she wanted.</p>
