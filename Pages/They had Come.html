				<h1> Short Story:</h1>
				<div class = "storytext">
				<p>Bombardments of artillery and the gunshots of rifles far away permeated the once-great city of New York. The once shining skyscrapers of concrete and glass are now reduced to mere ghosts of their true form. Streaks of white fill the sky as roaring fighter aircraft dogfight amongst the clouds.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But the enemies that the militaries fought amongst this War of Worlds was not any faction you and I would be familiar with. They were not Terrorists, an enemy Nation, or Aliens from a different planet but they were ourselves but not. They were Humans but not of Our Earth but from a different Earth that ran dried and empty. They had come for our resources in droves of Machines and Men aiming for our cities.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Entire companies of soldiers were wiped out in mere seconds as War Machines of unknown construction using weapons of untold destruction. The bellowing sounds of War Machines filled the streets of New York as metal creaked and groaned as it crushed the concrete underneath. Broken and abandoned vehicles blared their horns in the streets as mechanical legs strolled through the abandoned wreckages foretelling destruction with their path.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Their weapons held power beyond our own. They had technologies that we thought would never be possible. Their War Machines broke through our cities blockading them from any support, and their troops retaliated in any attempt to resist. They had taken our capitals, and our command leaving us with barely any time to react to their attack. By the time our Militaries mobilised and our Governments reformed, it was too late. Millions had died already.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The wreckages of long-abandoned tanks and Humvees litter the roads. Craters of artillery and blasted off debris from surrounding buildings made entire routes and roads nearly impossible to trek through but for Them, it was but a simple walk. Troops patrol these hallowed streets armed with firearms of unknown make and fitted with an insignia of a metallic grey UN emblazoned on their shoulder plates. Their helmet lenses glowed an ominous orange as they searched for more victims to engage with.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When we finally mobilized and retaliated against Them, we were not ready for the horrors we would face. Entire battalions would fall to Their War Machines from weaponry that seemed impossible to fathom. Their infantry was like super-soldiers of fiction made real as they danced on the battlefield tearing our infantry apart with the grace of experienced operators. They had won that day covered in the blood of themselves in a battlefield littered with corpses.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Aircraft fell from the sky like shooting stars as entire squadrons of Their Aircraft shot them down with precise accuracy. The forces of Earth were being eradicated with ease and intent, each movement and shot from Them planned and executed with swiftness. The retreat was our final option but when Aircraft changed their paths, infantry battalions turned their backs was when fortune finally ran out. We had been corralled into a massacre. The entire city burned with infernal flame as it weeded both Them and Us with impunity and wrath. The last of the rebellion had been burned and with it, the last chance for a once free Earth with it but shreds of hope for the populace and Us live on in the nondescript corners of the Earth.</p>
				<br>
				<p>And so, the era of Freedom ended and the age of Subjugation started once more...</p>
