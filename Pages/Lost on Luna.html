				<h1> Part 1:</h1>
				<div class = "storytext">
				<p> The lander's engine sputtered shuddering the entire craft's hull. It was almost the 14th try that Astronaut Mulder tried restarting his liftoff procedure that week ever since he was grounded on the Moon almost a month ago. Supposedly the ignition sequence for the main liftoff engines had malfunctioned during the landing and was now effectively stuck on the moon. Command announced that he could wait for at least one more month with the onboard supplies and rations, he had until they could send an impromptu rescue mission. Sighing once more in resignation, he walked away from the instruments.</p>

				<p>He could see the barren cratered wasteland of the moon's surface from the module windows next to his bunk. It was currently "daytime" on the moon, light from the sun illuminating the gray rocky beauty of Luna. He saw the blue marble from where hope, dream, and human life had started, blossomed, and wilted in an eternal cycle and he was so far away from it all, away from his friends, family, and everything. Mulder was scared...</p>
				<br>
				<p>He would probably be the first ever person to die on the Moon. It terrified him, every waking moment could be his last from one more mechanical failure or a dust particle forgotten. Whenever these thoughts of his got the best of him, Mulder would always walk around the moon for a bit to clear his head. There was something peaceful wandering around a celestial planet untouched by human life or life at all. An eerie silence would always permeate these walks only the sounds of his suit and footsteps being his only companion. Suiting up into his suit once more to clear his mind once more from his anxiety. The Lander felt so suffocated and pressured all the time but the surface felt so free in comparison even confined to his suit which felt almost like a second skin after weeks of use. Opening the airlock, the iconic hiss of air sounded once more revealing the blasted grey wasteland of Luna's grace. He took one footstep down from the ladder and one leap to the ground disturbing a puff of moon dust across the surface. Mulder stood in awe of Luna even after all these walks, the view never got old.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Off he went following the same path, he would always follow when he went for these kinds of walks. Across the perimeter of the landing area to check the scientific instruments then unto the edge of the cliff to admire the shear height and drop of the formation and finally to the hill next to the Lander. The Hill had always been one of Mulder's favorite places since he arrived on Luna's surface with the view of the Sun dipping below the horizon and covering the land in pitch dark felt like uneasy comfort as the lights of the site turned on.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But this time was different as he finished his routine and sat upon his chair admiring the sunset again, something was different. When the Sun finally dipped, and as the bulbs of the site turned on bathing everything in light, there was one shining light off in the distance. Almost blinding as it shone, 'divine' Mulder would've thought if he was a more religious man. The light was a pure white in comparison to the dark grey of the landscape surrounding it.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Through compulsion of a higher power or mere curiosity, Mulder strode towards the source of mystery on the moon. From his estimations, it was only a mere 500 meters away well under the limit that his oxygen could take allowing him to take this detour of his average routine. With every step and cloud of dust he made, the light seemed to focus on a shape he was well familiar with. It was humanoid, with lots of light shaped like a halo and wings, the shape of an actual angel in reality.</p>
				<p>Shock and awe went through his mind as he inched ever closer to the being of his fascination. Details seemed to clear with every step closer to his goal, painting the image of an angel dressed in a modest white gown holding a map with confusion painted on her face. Mulder thought he must've gone mad, probably insane as he got ever closer but the senses of reality grounded him and told him that it was the truth.</p>
				<p>An angel was lost on the moon and he was the only one who could help. The mere thought of such a sentence sent him into a stupor but he moved ever closer to the lost woman.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>Gabriela was lost on Luna. The utter thought of those words sent her into a tizzy. She was given a simple assignment to guide one of humanity's lost souls amongst its surface and she had gotten herself lost on it just like the soul she was supposed to save. She turned over the Divine Map of Luna once again desperately trying to orient herself with the image once more but she failed just like the last thirty-eight times.</p>
				<br>
				<p>She couldn't believe it, her sisters and brothers in The Divine Realm would make fun of her for her first assignment being lost. She would not let herself get lost in The Realm of the Physical once more like in her previous training assignments and classes. But as confusion painted her face, she noticed an unlikely figure slowly approaching her. A figure that was slowly coming into view as it got ever closer to her.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The shape of the figure focused into one of the suits those Mortals would use for the traversal of the Void. Details of its many instruments and technologies got ever clearer with every step; her assignment had come to her.</p>
				<br><br><br><br><br>
				<p>When Mulder was close enough to the Angel, he saw relief upon her face that slowly turned into shock and quite quickly into a frantic panic. The large map that she held was quickly waved towards him as to shoo him away from her presence but he was not deterred. By the time he was right next to the angel with only five meters between them, the entity had helped itself to hide behind the map she had held.</p>
				<p>Divinity seemed to radiate warmth from her presence; it reminded Mulder of the cold nights warming up next to his grandparent's fireplace in the winter. The details of the woman in front of him were now clear for him to see. A white gown made of clearly shining godly cloth glistened in the near-pitch blackness of the Moon's surface. Wings of unimaginable length and feathers sprouted directly from her back. And a Halo floating atop her head of pure light it seemed; she was the spitting of the image of the angels of myth</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>She was dead. When the knowledge that her mortal assignment had found her in person was found out, she would be metaphorically dead and stricken from interacting with the Realm of The Physical ever again. Gabriela was embarrassed and flustered at the current events unfolding, she hadn't met another mortal since the Ages of Sword and Honor; those were almost centuries when she was a mere Changeling. Now she was confronted by the advancement of those mortals touching the void and grasping it with their bare hands.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>Now I would've gone into detail about the stoicism of Mulder and the refined grace of Gabriela in their acts in first meeting each other but that would blatantly be wrong. </p>
				<br>
				<p>For the first ten seconds of each staring at the other had instinctively hit the switch in the heads of both Man and Angel alike to enter a state known to all things made by The One Above All. They both screamed.</p>
				<br>
				<p>While let it be known, that the screams emitted by our resident human would've never left the vibrations of his suit allowing him the respite of privacy and myth forever more of such an act; could not be said about the screaming of our angel. Gabriela was a guardian of The Divine Realm for as long as she had materialized; formed from the screaming incomprehensible gestalt of the universe that birthed new angels. Everything about her had worked on different rules with her mere presence in The Physical acting as nails to the metaphysical chalkboard of reality.
				When she screamed, strings of reality vibrated her tone trembling into the ears of poor Mulder. These strings of reality would bend and stretch throughout the universe causing quite the disturbance of headaches and an overall bad time for the mortals on Earth.
				Those vibrations upon the fabric of reality itself would then be forever recorded by the string weavers of the Divine where her scream would live forever as fact and constant embarrassment. Such violations of the Divine Code of Interaction would not be the first of her issues at all.</p>
