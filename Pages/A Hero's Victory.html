				<h1> Short Story:</h1>
				<div class = "storytext">
				<p>As she stood her ground upon the bloody battlefield, the air blew through her ruby hair. Her weapon, Avalon's Bane shining brightly at the sight of the setting sun, it was protruding from the ground, its blade still sharp from battle. Bodies were scattered amongst the battlefield with blood pooling in the crevices and craters. The knight stood amongst the bodies and strewn out weapons and cried to the high heavens above, the scream filling the silent battlefield with sound once more. Her armour, battered and torn once brought feelings of strength and safety but the bloodstained cloth underneath the once shining steel armour plate now dulled and warped only brought a sense of entrapment and guilt to her.</p>
<br>
<p>The war was now over but the thoughts of its cost still lingered on her mind; friends, enemies, and even mere acquaintances were now just bodies littered amongst the ground and dirt of the Stronghold once held by the Tempests of The Sun.</p>
<br>
<p>Her emotions reached their peak so she cried looking upon the bloody aftermath of the battle with the bodies of the men she had slaughtered mocking her. Her thoughts drifted to the beginning of this madness wondering if she could've done something different to change the outcome of things but as she wracked her mind of what-ifs, she knew deep down that no matter what she could've done, the outcome would've been the same. The tears from her face quickly dried with only the mere silence of her surroundings being her only companion as the sun faded away from view dipping down below the horizon.</p>
<br>
<p>The night now falling upon her, the once-proud knight of the Midnight Order fell unto her knees, and let the tears for her companions fall. Through the tears, memories began to surface on how everything began with that quaint first meeting, five years ago with that old dim-witted elf. She smiled to herself thinking back to that old memory, 'Oh how that old man never got my name right' as the memories of her travelling party's old antics focused into view as the sky quickly turned into a dark twilight. She silently whispered to the dismay of the peaceful silence the words blown away by the breeze.</p>
<br>
<p>The fatigue of the events that had transpired mere hours ago was now taking their toll on her body with pain becoming apparent as the adrenaline was flushed, the pain she felt of her limbs eventually came to be too much so with her last few dredges of energy, she took to rest in the shade of a tree nearby, laying upon its bark for support.</p>
